## General info
In this project, I am using a neural network to classify the wheat dataset.


### Data set informations
The examined group comprised kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat: Kama, Rosa and Canadian, 70 elements each, randomly selected for the experiment. The dataset has been downloaded from the site: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds


## Requirements
Python 3.7.0,
Libraries: random, math, json, matplotlib, logging, os


## Setup
To run this project, copy file ConfigDefault.py change name this file on Config.py and change the values in the file to the appropriate ones, next start ClassifierNN.


You must have the appropriate libraries installed. Examply using cmd:

```
pip install matplotlib
```

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lublin for providing the data set
